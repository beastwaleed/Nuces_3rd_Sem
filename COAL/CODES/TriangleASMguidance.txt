Sure! Here is a detailed explanation of each line of your code for easy reference. You can copy this into a notepad for future use:

---

 -->-->Code Explanation (Line-by-Line)-->-->

 `[org 0x0100]`
- -->-->Sets the code origin to 0x0100-->-->. This is common in real-mode programs that are loaded by DOS. It means the program will start at memory address `0x0100`.

 `jmp start`
- -->-->Jump to the label `start`-->-->. This skips over the subroutines and directly starts executing the code at the `start` label.

---

 -->-->Subroutine: `clrscr` (Clear Screen)-->-->
This routine clears the screen by writing blank spaces to all character positions.

 `push es`
- -->-->Saves the value of the `es` register-->--> onto the stack for later restoration.

 `push ax`
- -->-->Saves the value of the `ax` register-->--> onto the stack for later use.

 `push di`
- -->-->Saves the value of the `di` register-->--> onto the stack for later use.

 `mov ax, 0xb800`
- -->-->Moves the base address of the video memory-->--> (0xb800) into `ax`. In text mode, video memory starts at this address.

 `mov es, ax`
- -->-->Moves the value in `ax` (0xb800)-->--> into the extra segment register `es`, setting it to point to video memory.

 `mov di, 0`
- -->-->Sets the destination index register `di` to 0-->-->, starting at the top-left of the screen in video memory.

 `nextloc:`
- -->-->Label-->--> used as a loop entry point.

 `mov word [es:di], 0x0720`
- -->-->Writes a space (' ') with the attribute 0x07-->--> (white text on black background) to the location in video memory pointed to by `es:di`.

 `add di, 2`
- -->-->Increments `di` by 2-->--> to move to the next character cell. Each character occupies 2 bytes (1 for the ASCII value, 1 for the attribute).

 `cmp di, 4000`
- -->-->Compares the value of `di` to 4000-->-->. This is because 80 columns --> 25 rows = 2000 characters, and each character requires 2 bytes, so 4000 bytes total.

 `jne nextloc`
- -->-->If `di` is not equal to 4000-->-->, jump back to `nextloc` to continue clearing the screen.

 `pop di`
- -->-->Restores the value of `di`-->--> from the stack.

 `pop ax`
- -->-->Restores the value of `ax`-->--> from the stack.

 `pop es`
- -->-->Restores the value of `es`-->--> from the stack.

 `ret`
- -->-->Returns from the subroutine-->-->. The screen is now cleared.

---

 -->-->Subroutine: `pyramid`-->-->
This routine draws a pyramid of `-->` characters on the screen.

 `push bp`
- -->-->Saves the base pointer `bp`-->--> onto the stack for later restoration.

 `mov bp, sp`
- -->-->Sets the base pointer `bp` to the current stack pointer `sp`-->-->, used for accessing parameters on the stack.

 `mov ax, 0xb800`
- -->-->Loads the video memory segment address (0xb800)-->--> into `ax`.

 `mov es, ax`
- -->-->Moves the value of `ax` (0xb800)-->--> into `es`, pointing to video memory.

 `mov al, 80`
- -->-->Loads the number of columns on the screen (80)-->--> into `al`.

 `mul byte [bp+4]`
- -->-->Multiplies the value in `al` (80) by the Y-position-->--> passed as a parameter, stored at `[bp+4]`. The result is placed in `ax`.

 `add ax, [bp+6]`
- -->-->Adds the X-position-->--> (passed at `[bp+6]`) to `ax`. Now `ax` contains the character position offset on the screen.

 `shl ax, 1`
- -->-->Shifts `ax` left by 1-->--> (multiplies it by 2). Since each character requires 2 bytes (character + attribute), this gives the byte offset in video memory.

 `mov di, ax`
- -->-->Moves the calculated byte offset into `di`-->--> (destination index), which points to the exact location in video memory where the pyramid starts.

 `mov ah, 0x07`
- -->-->Sets the attribute byte for the characters-->--> to 0x07 (white text on black background).

 `mov cx, 1`
- -->-->Sets `cx` to 1-->-->. This is used as a counter for the number of `-->` characters to be printed in each row of the pyramid.

 `mov bx, ax`
- -->-->Copies the value of `ax`-->--> (the starting screen position) into `bx`, which will hold the base offset for each row.

---

 `l1:`
- -->-->Label-->--> for the outer loop that handles drawing each row of the pyramid.

 `mov si, cx`
- -->-->Copies the value of `cx`-->--> (the number of `-->` to print on the current row) into `si`.

 `mov bx, di`
- -->-->Copies `di` into `bx`-->-->. This resets the column position to the starting position for the current row.

 `l2:`
- -->-->Label-->--> for the inner loop that draws individual `-->` characters on the current row.

 `mov word [es:di], 0x072A`
- -->-->Writes a `-->` character (`0x2A` is ASCII for `-->`) with attribute `0x07`-->--> (white on black) to the video memory at `es:di`.

 `add di, 2`
- -->-->Increments `di` by 2-->--> to move to the next column.

 `dec si`
- -->-->Decreases `si` by 1-->-->, counting down how many `-->` remain to be drawn on the current row.

 `cmp si, 0`
- -->-->Compares `si` to 0-->-->. If all `-->` have been drawn on the row, the inner loop terminates.

 `jne l2`
- -->-->If `si` is not zero-->-->, jump back to `l2` to draw the next `-->`.

 `add bx, 158`
- -->-->Moves to the start of the next row-->--> by adding 158 to `bx`. Each row in video memory takes 160 bytes (80 columns --> 2 bytes per character), but we subtract 2 because `bx` already points to the last character of the previous row.

 `mov di, bx`
- -->-->Moves the updated `bx` value into `di`-->-->, positioning `di` at the start of the next row.

 `add cx, 1`
- -->-->Increments `cx` by 1-->-->, increasing the number of `-->` to print on the next row.

 `cmp cx, 7`
- -->-->Compares `cx` to 7-->-->. This limits the pyramid to 6 rows (since it starts from 1).

 `jne l1`
- -->-->If `cx` is less than 7-->-->, jump back to `l1` to draw the next row.

---

 `pop bp`
- -->-->Restores the base pointer-->--> from the stack.

 `ret 4`
- -->-->Returns from the subroutine-->-->, cleaning up the stack (4 bytes) that were pushed for the X and Y parameters.

---

 -->-->Main Program: `start`-->-->

 `call clrscr`
- -->-->Calls the `clrscr` subroutine-->--> to clear the screen.

 `mov ax, 15`
- -->-->Loads the value 15 (X-position)-->--> into `ax`.

 `push ax`
- -->-->Pushes the X-position onto the stack-->--> for the `pyramid` function.

 `mov ax, 5`
- -->-->Loads the value 5 (Y-position)-->--> into `ax`.

 `push ax`
- -->-->Pushes the Y-position onto the stack-->--> for the `pyramid` function.

 `call pyramid`
- -->-->Calls the `pyramid` subroutine-->-->, which draws a pyramid starting at `(X=15, Y=5)`.

 `mov ax, 0x4c00`
- -->-->Prepares to exit the program-->--> by loading the DOS interrupt for program termination into `ax`.

 `int 0x21`
- -->-->Calls interrupt 0x21-->--> to terminate the program.
